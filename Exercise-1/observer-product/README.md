# ðŸ“¢ Observer Pattern â€“ Product Notifications Example

## 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Observer Design Pattern** using an **E-Commerce Product Notification System**.  

In the system:
- Customers (observers) can **subscribe** to notifications for a specific product.  
- When the product comes back **in stock** (state change), all subscribed customers are automatically **notified** via Email or SMS.  
- This pattern decouples the product (subject) from its subscribers (observers), allowing flexible notification management.

5. How Observer Pattern is Applied
The Observer Pattern is applied as follows:

Observer â†’ Interface for all observers (customers).

Customer â†’ Implements Observer and receives notifications.

Product â†’ Subject that maintains a list of observers and notifies them on state changes.

EcommerceApp â†’ Client application that allows customers to subscribe and triggers restock events.

UML-like Structure
```
Observer (Interface)
       â†‘
   Customer

Subject: Product
  - List<Observer>
  - attach(Observer)
  - detach(Observer)
  - notifyObservers()

EcommerceApp (Client)
```
6. Key Benefits
âœ… Decouples Subject and Observers â†’ Product does not depend on how notifications are sent.

âœ… Dynamic Subscription â†’ Observers can subscribe/unsubscribe at runtime.

âœ… Automatic Updates â†’ All subscribers are notified whenever the product state changes.

âœ… Flexible and Scalable â†’ Can add new notification methods (Email/SMS/Push) easily.

7. Conclusion
The Observer Pattern allows a product to broadcast state changes to multiple subscribers in a flexible and maintainable way.
Itâ€™s a real-world analogy of e-commerce notifications for back-in-stock products.
