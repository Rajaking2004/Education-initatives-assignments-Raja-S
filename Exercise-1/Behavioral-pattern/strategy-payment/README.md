# ðŸ’³ Strategy Pattern â€“ E-Commerce Payment Checkout Example

## 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Strategy Design Pattern** using an **E-Commerce Checkout System**.  

In the system:
- The `Order` class delegates payment processing to an **IPaymentStrategy**.  
- Users can choose different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, UPI) **at runtime**.  
- The payment logic is **encapsulated** in separate strategy classes, making it easy to add new payment methods later.

=== E-Commerce Checkout (Strategy Pattern) ===
Enter order amount: 1000

Choose payment method: 1) Credit Card  2) PayPal  3) UPI  4) Checkout & Exit
2
Enter PayPal email: universe@gmail.com
?? Processing PayPal payment of $1000.0 for account: universe@gmail.com

Choose payment method: 1) Credit Card  2) PayPal  3) UPI  4) Checkout & Exit
3
Enter UPI ID (e.g., user@bank): universe@statebank
? Processing UPI payment of $1000.0 via UPI ID: universe@statebank

Choose payment method: 1) Credit Card  2) PayPal  3) UPI  4) Checkout & Exit

5. How Strategy Pattern is Applied
The Strategy Pattern is applied as follows:

IPaymentStrategy â†’ Interface defining the pay method.

CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, UPIPayment â†’ Concrete strategies implementing IPaymentStrategy.

Order â†’ Maintains a reference to IPaymentStrategy and delegates the payment process to it.

CheckoutApp â†’ Client application selects the strategy at runtime.

UML-like Structure
```
IPaymentStrategy (Interface)
       â†‘
-------------------------------
|            |               |
CreditCard  PayPal          UPI
Payment    Payment        Payment

Order (Context)  -->  uses IPaymentStrategy
CheckoutApp (Client)
```
6. Key Benefits
âœ… Flexible Payment Options â†’ Users can choose at runtime.

âœ… Open/Closed Principle â†’ New payment methods can be added without modifying Order.

âœ… Encapsulates Behavior â†’ Payment logic is separated from order processing.

âœ… Reusable and Maintainable â†’ Each payment strategy is independent.
